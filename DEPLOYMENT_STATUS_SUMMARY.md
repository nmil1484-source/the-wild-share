# Vercel Deployment Status Summary
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Project:** The Wild Share Frontend  
**Status:** 🔴 **DEPLOYMENT FAILING - Needs Manual Vercel UI Configuration**

---

## Current Problem

Vercel deployment keeps failing with the same error:
```
[vite:build-html] Failed to resolve ./src/main.jsx from /vercel/path1/index.html
```

**Root Cause:** The Root Directory setting in Vercel UI is conflicting with the monorepo structure, causing Vite to look for files in the wrong location.

---

## What We've Tried (All Failed)

1. ✅ Fixed Flask detection → Changed Framework Preset to Vite
2. ✅ Fixed dependency conflicts → Downgraded date-fns to 3.6.0, upgraded react-day-picker to 9.11.1
3. ✅ Created `.vercelignore` → Successfully removed 202 backend files
4. ✅ Fixed `__dirname` in `vite.config.js` → Properly defined for ES modules
5. ✅ Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` → Matched package.json changes
6. ✅ Changed script path in `index.html` → From `/src/main.jsx` to `./src/main.jsx`
7. ✅ Created root-level `vercel.json` with `cwd: rental-site`

**All attempts still result in the same build error!**

---

## The Solution (Needs Manual Action)

### Step 1: Remove Root Directory Setting in Vercel UI

1. Go to Vercel project: https://vercel.com/nmil1484-sources-projects/the-wild-share-frontend
2. Click **Settings** → **General**
3. Scroll to **Root Directory**
4. Click **Edit**
5. **Clear the field** (remove "rental-site")
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Wait for New Deployment

After removing the Root Directory setting, the new `vercel.json` at the repository root will take over:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "cwd": "rental-site"
}
```

The `cwd: rental-site` tells Vercel to run all commands FROM the rental-site directory, which should fix the path resolution issue.

## Alternative: Give Manus Vercel API Access

To avoid manual screenshot sharing and allow automated deployment management:

### Create Vercel API Token

1. Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Click **Create Token**
3. Name it: "Manus Deployment Automation"
4. Select scope: **Full Account**
5. Click **Create**
6. Copy the token

### Provide Token to Manus

Just paste the token in the chat, and Manus can:
- Check deployment status automatically
- Update Vercel settings via API
- Trigger manual deployments
- Read build logs directly
- Fix issues without requiring screenshots

└── vercel.json           ← Root-level config with cwd setting
```

### Vercel Settings (Current)
- **Framework Preset:** Vite ✅
- **Root Directory:** rental-site ⚠️ **NEEDS TO BE REMOVED**
- **Build Command:** (auto-detected from vercel.json)
- **Output Directory:** (auto-detected from vercel.json)
- **Install Command:** (auto-detected from vercel.json)

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_API_URL`: `https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app` ✅
- Stripe key: Hardcoded in code as fallback ✅

### Backend (Railway)
- **URL:** https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app
- **Status:** ✅ Working
- **CORS:** Updated to allow Vercel domain

## Next Steps (When You Wake Up)

1. **Remove Root Directory setting** in Vercel UI (see Step 1 above)
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for new deployment
3. **Check deployment status** at https://vercel.com/nmil1484-sources-projects/the-wild-share-frontend
4. **If successful:**
   - Test the site at https://www.thewildshare.com
   - Test admin dashboard
   - Test Stripe boost purchase feature
   - Test security deposit field
5. **If still failing:**
   - Provide Vercel API token to Manus
   - Let Manus debug and fix automatically
