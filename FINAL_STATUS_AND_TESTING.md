## üîß IMPLEMENTED (Awaiting Final Test)

### 5. Stripe Boost Purchase Flow
**Status:** Code complete, deployed, testing cache issues

**What Was Built:**
- ‚úÖ `BoostSelectionModal.jsx` component
- ‚úÖ Boost state management in App.jsx
- ‚úÖ `handleBoostPurchase()` function
- ‚úÖ `handleBoostSuccess()` callback
- ‚úÖ Integration with PricingPage component
- ‚úÖ Backend API already exists (`/api/boost/purchase`)

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// In App.jsx
const [showBoostModal, setShowBoostModal] = useState(false)
const [selectedBoostType, setSelectedBoostType] = useState(null)

const handleBoostPurchase = async (equipmentId, boostType) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/boost/purchase', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      equipment_id: equipmentId,
      boost_type: boostType
    })
  })
  const data = await response.json()
  if (data.success) {
    window.location.href = data.checkout_url // Redirect to Stripe
  }
}
```

**Testing Needed:**
1. Click "Boost a Listing" button on Pricing page
2. Verify modal opens with equipment list
3. Select equipment and confirm
4. Verify redirect to Stripe checkout
5. Complete test payment
6. Verify boost activates on equipment

### 6. Admin Dashboard
**Status:** Component exists, deployed, testing cache issues

**What Exists:**
- ‚úÖ `AdminDashboard.jsx` component (fully built)
- ‚úÖ Imported in App.jsx
- ‚úÖ Conditional rendering based on `user.is_admin`
- ‚úÖ Backend admin API endpoints exist

**Features:**
- User management (ban, approve)
- Equipment moderation
- Booking oversight
- Platform statistics
- Search and filtering

**Testing Needed:**
1. Click "Admin" button in navigation
2. Verify admin dashboard loads (not profile page)
3. Test user management features
4. Test equipment moderation
5. Verify statistics display

---

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Cache Problem
**Issue:** Browser/CDN serving old JavaScript bundles  
**Symptoms:**
- Boost button redirects to equipment page instead of opening modal
- Admin button goes to profile instead of admin dashboard

**Solutions Attempted:**
1. ‚úÖ Manual Railway redeploy
2. ‚úÖ Hard browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. ‚úÖ Added comment to force rebuild
4. ‚úÖ Added hash-based filenames (most aggressive)

**Latest Fix (In Progress):**
- Added `[hash]` to all asset filenames in vite.config.js
- This forces browsers to treat files as completely new
- Deployment in progress

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (After Testing)

### If Boost & Admin Work:
1. ‚úÖ Mark both features as complete
2. Document Stripe test mode vs production
3. Add boost analytics/tracking
4. Implement contract download feature
5. Add messaging to equipment browsing

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check Railway build logs for errors
2. Verify Flask static file serving
3. Consider adding `Cache-Control` headers
4. Test in incognito/private browsing mode
5. Check browser DevTools Network tab

## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

### Deployment Challenges:
- Vite build output directory was incorrect
- Browser caching very aggressive
- Hash-based filenames are essential
- Railway auto-deploy works well

### What Worked:
- Systematic debugging approach
- Comprehensive documentation
- Git version control
- Modular component design

---

## üìû SUPPORT

**If issues persist:**
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Test in incognito mode
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Check browser DevTools console
5. Verify Stripe API keys are set

**Stripe Test Mode:**
- Test Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
