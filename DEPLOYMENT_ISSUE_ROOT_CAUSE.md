# Deployment Issue Root Cause Analysis

## Problem
- Admin button still goes to Profile Settings instead of Admin Dashboard
- Boost purchase button still redirects to Equipment page instead of opening modal
- Even after multiple deployments, the old JavaScript is being served

## Evidence
1. **Live site serves:** `/assets/index-BTBH8ggM.js` (OLD hash)
2. **Local build creates:** `/assets/index-i_S1zVgg.js` (NEW hash)
3. **Railway deployment:** Shows "Deployment successful" but serves old files

## Railway Build Process (from logs)
```
stage-0 RUN cd rental-site && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
stage-0 RUN cd rental-site && VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=... npm run build
stage-0 RUN mkdir -p backend/src/static
stage-0 RUN rm -rf backend/src/static/*
stage-0 RUN cp -r rental-site/dist/* backend/src/static/
```

## Hypothesis
Railway is using **Docker layer caching** and not rebuilding the frontend even though the code changed. The `npm run build` step might be cached from a previous build.

## Solution Attempts
1. ✅ Disabled "Wait for CI" - Deployments now trigger immediately
2. ✅ Added no-cache headers to Flask - Doesn't help if wrong files are built
3. ✅ Added cache-busting to vite config - Doesn't help if build is cached
4. ❌ Multiple redeployments - Railway keeps using cached build

## Next Steps
1. Force Railway to rebuild without cache
2. Check if nixpacks.toml needs modification
3. Consider adding a build timestamp to force cache invalidation
