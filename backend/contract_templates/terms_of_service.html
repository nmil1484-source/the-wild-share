    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">Last Updated: October 26, 2025</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Welcome to The Wild Share! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our outdoor equipment rental marketplace. By using our platform, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Platform</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>The Wild Share is a peer-to-peer marketplace that connects equipment owners with individuals seeking to rent outdoor gear. We are not a party to any rental agreement between users. We do not own, control, or manage any of the equipment listed on our platform.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>You must create an account to use most features of The Wild Share. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to keep your account information updated. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>As a user of The Wild Share, you agree to:
            <ul>
                <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                <li>Provide accurate and honest information in your listings and communications.</li>
                <li>Treat other users with respect and courtesy.</li>
                <li>Use the platform only for its intended purpose.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Listings and Bookings</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Owners are responsible for the accuracy and content of their listings. Renters are responsible for reading the full listing before booking. A booking is a limited license to use the owner's equipment for the agreed-upon period. The owner reserves the right to cancel a booking if the renter violates these Terms or the rental agreement.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Fees and Payments</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>We charge a platform fee for each booking, which is a percentage of the total rental cost. All payments are processed through our third-party payment provider, Stripe. By making or receiving payments on The Wild Share, you agree to Stripe's terms of service.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Our cancellation and refund policy is outlined in the rental agreement. We encourage users to communicate directly to resolve any issues. The Wild Share may, in its sole discretion, issue refunds or credits.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>7. Damage to Equipment</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Renters are responsible for returning the equipment in the same condition it was received, normal wear and tear excepted. Renters are liable for any damage to or loss of the equipment during the rental period. The security deposit will be used to cover the cost of repairs or replacement. If the cost exceeds the deposit, the renter is responsible for the remaining amount.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>The Wild Share is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. We do not endorse any user, listing, or equipment. We are not responsible for any damage, injury, or loss arising from your use of the platform or rental of equipment.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Wild Share shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of our platform.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any material changes by posting the new Terms on the platform. Your continued use of The Wild Share after the effective date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
