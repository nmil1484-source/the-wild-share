# Vercel Deployment In Progress

**Time:** October 31, 2025 01:43 UTC  
**Status:** Vercel deployment initiated, waiting for completion

## Deployment Details

**Project Name:** the-wild-share-frontend  
**Repository:** nmil1484-source/the-wild-share  
**Branch:** main  
**Deployment URL (from URL bar):** the-wild-share-frontend-3zvdoymys-nmil1484-sources-projects.vercel.app  
**Expected Production URL:** the-wild-share-frontend.vercel.app

## What's Happening

1. ‚úÖ User created Vercel project
2. ‚úÖ User configured project settings
3. üîÑ Vercel is building the frontend (in progress)
4. ‚è≥ Waiting for build to complete
5. ‚è≥ Need to get final production URL
6. ‚è≥ Update backend CORS
7. ‚è≥ Test features

## Next Immediate Steps

Once user confirms deployment is complete:

1. Get the production URL from Vercel dashboard
2. Run: `python3 update_cors_for_vercel.py https://[production-url]`
3. Commit and push CORS changes
4. Wait for Railway to redeploy backend
5. Test admin dashboard and boost purchase

## Environment Variables Status

User should have added these in Vercel:
- ‚úÖ VITE_API_URL = https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app
- ‚úÖ VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_test_51SJPdQGW9js9GVkoZfMrWFNQkyGJGyW9Ls6Aisq4tGlYN2UNLG9HvS36YwjO51kHNTKvIgx5ImLK6I8PpjEV2zg700WKXnDRQ5

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Build fails** - Check if root directory was set to `rental-site`
2. **Environment variables missing** - Verify both vars were added
3. **Wrong URL** - Make sure to use production URL, not preview URL

## Expected Outcome

Once complete:
- Frontend will be live on Vercel
- No more Railway caching issues
- Admin dashboard will work
- Boost purchase will work
- All features will be accessible
