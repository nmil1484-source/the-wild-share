## ❌ Deployment Issue

### **Problem: Railway Not Auto-Deploying**

**Status:** All code changes are committed and pushed to GitHub, but Railway has NOT automatically deployed them.

**Evidence:**
- GitHub shows latest commits from Oct 31, 2025
- Live site (thewildshare.com) still shows OLD code:
  - Homepage says "50% deposit held to protect equipment" (should say "Owner-set refundable deposits")
  - Equipment form missing security_deposit field
  - Edit modal still has image URL field issue

**Railway Deployment URL:** `https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app`

**Possible Causes:**
1. Railway webhook not configured for the-wild-share repository
2. The Wild Share deployed under different Railway account
3. Manual deployment trigger required
4. Railway project not connected to GitHub repository

## 🔧 Next Steps to Fix Deployment

### Option 1: Find and Access Correct Railway Project
1. Log into the Railway account that has The Wild Share deployed
2. Look for project with:
   - Frontend service connected to `nmil1484-source/the-wild-share` repo
   - Backend service connected to same repo
   - Custom domain: thewildshare.com
3. Check deployment status and logs

### Option 2: Manual Deployment Trigger
1. Access Railway dashboard for The Wild Share project
2. Go to the frontend service
3. Click "Deploy" → "Redeploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
5. Go to backend service
6. Click "Deploy" → "Redeploy"
7. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Option 3: Verify GitHub Webhook
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to Webhooks
3. Check if Railway webhook exists and is active
4. If missing, add Railway webhook from Railway dashboard

### Option 4: Check Railway CLI
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/wild-share-deploy
railway login
railway status
railway list
railway logs
```
