# Admin Dashboard Fix - Progress Summary

## Issue
Admin button visible but clicking it shows Profile Settings instead of Admin Dashboard. Console shows `is_admin: undefined`.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database ✅ FIXED (Previous Session)
- Added `is_admin`, `is_banned`, `ban_reason` columns to users table
- Set `is_admin=TRUE` for admin@thewildshare.com
- **Status:** Database schema is correct

### 2. Backend Model ✅ FIXED (Previous Session)  
- User model has `is_admin` field defined
- `to_dict()` method includes `is_admin` on line 69
- **Status:** Backend code is correct

### 3. Frontend State Management ❌ FOUND & FIXED (This Session)
**Problem:** User data not persisted to localStorage
- Login only saved `access_token`, not user data
- On page refresh, user state was lost
- `is_admin` was undefined because user object was empty

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated login handler to save user to localStorage (line 329)
- Updated logout to remove user from localStorage (line 362)
- Updated loadUser() to save user to localStorage (line 176)
- Updated useEffect to load user from localStorage on mount (lines 136-142)

**Files Changed:**
- `rental-site/src/App.jsx`

### 4. Deployment Issue ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Problem:** Railway not deploying latest code
- Frontend shows old JS file: `index-BQHp0KjT.js`
- Backend API not returning `is_admin` field
- Suggests Railway cached old backend code

**Solution Applied:**
- Forced redeploy by adding comment to `main.py`
- Waiting for Railway to rebuild (2-3 minutes)

## Additional Fixes Applied

### Stripe Connect Onboarding ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Buttons tried to navigate to non-existent `/api/payments/connect/onboard`

**Solution:**
- Created new `/api/stripe/onboard` endpoint (GET)
- Handles token from query parameter
- Creates Stripe account if needed
- Redirects to Stripe onboarding flow
- Updated both Stripe Connect buttons in App.jsx

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/routes/stripe_connect.py` - Added onboard() function
- `rental-site/src/App.jsx` - Updated button onClick handlers (lines 1208-1211, 1393-1396)

## Testing Plan

Once Railway deployment completes:

1. **Hard refresh** the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Logout** and **login** again as admin@thewildshare.com
3. **Check localStorage** - should have `user` key with `is_admin: true`
4. **Click Admin button** - should show Admin Dashboard
5. **Test Stripe Connect** - buttons should redirect to Stripe onboarding

## Commits Made

1. `b2ae10ad` - Fix Stripe Connect onboarding flow - add /onboard endpoint
2. `d9f644a6` - Fix admin dashboard - save user data to localStorage including is_admin field  
3. `517e7417` - Force Railway redeploy

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete
2. Test admin dashboard functionality
3. Test Stripe Connect onboarding
4. Address mobile responsive issues (separate task)
5. Fix white-on-white text visibility (separate task)
