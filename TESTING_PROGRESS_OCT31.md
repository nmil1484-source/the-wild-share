# The Wild Share - Testing Progress Report
**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Time:** 22:33 UTC  
**Status:** Bug fixes deployed and verified

---

## Deployment Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

### Issue Resolved
The frontend changes were not deploying because the **vite.config.js** had the wrong output directory:
- **Wrong:** `outDir: '../src/static'` 
- **Correct:** `outDir: '../backend/src/static'`

This caused the build to output to the wrong location, and Railway was serving old cached files.

### Fix Applied
- Updated `vite.config.js` to output to correct directory
- Committed and pushed fix (commit: e6ff0d4a)
- Railway automatically deployed
- **Deployment successful at 22:29 UTC**
