## Deployment Issue Resolved

### Problem Discovered
After initial deployment, changes were not appearing on live site despite successful Railway builds.

### Root Cause
The `vite.config.js` had incorrect build output directory:
```javascript
// WRONG
outDir: '../src/static'

// CORRECT  
outDir: '../backend/src/static'
```

This caused the frontend build to output to `/src/static/` instead of `/backend/src/static/`, so Railway was serving old cached files from the backend static directory.

### Resolution
1. Identified issue through local build testing
2. Updated `vite.config.js` with correct output path
3. Committed and pushed fix (commit: e6ff0d4a)
4. Railway automatically deployed corrected build
5. Verified all changes now appear on live site

**Time to Resolution:** ~30 minutes from discovery to verification

## Outstanding Issues Identified

### High Priority 🟡

#### 1. Admin Dashboard Missing/Broken
**Issue:** Clicking "Admin" button leads to Profile Settings instead of admin dashboard

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin dashboard with overview

- View all bookings
- View all users
- Manage content
- Analytics and statistics

**Current Behavior:**
- "Admin" button opens Profile Settings page
- No way to access admin functionality
- Cannot edit equipment owned by other users

**Impact:** Prevents admin from managing platform

**Recommendation:** Investigate admin routing and permissions

---

#### 2. Contract Access/Download Missing
**Issue:** Users cannot access or download their rental contracts

**Current State:**
- Contracts are generated on booking
- No "My Contracts" or "Documents" section
