## ðŸš€ 3 Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Go to GitHub
Visit: https://github.com/nmil1484/the-wild-share

### Step 2: Replace wsgi.py
1. Click on **`wsgi.py`** file in the root directory
2. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit)
3. **Delete everything** and paste this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
WSGI entry point for The Wild Share application
"""
import os
import sys

# Add the current directory to Python path so 'src' module can be found
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
sys.path.insert(0, current_dir)

# Now import the app from src.main
from src.main import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

4. Click **Commit changes**
5. Add message: "Fix wsgi.py import path"
6. Click **Commit changes** again

### Step 3: Watch Railway Deploy

2. Click your project â†’ Deployments
3. Wait for the new deployment (starts automatically)
4. Look for: **"Database tables ready!"** in logs = SUCCESS! âœ…

Once deployed:
- **Railway URL**: https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app
- **Health Check**: https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app/health
- **Custom Domain**: http://www.thewildshare.com (may take 30 min for DNS)

## ðŸ†˜ Still Not Working?

Check Railway logs for errors:
1. Railway dashboard â†’ Your project
2. Click on the deployment
3. Read the logs for error messages

Common issues:
