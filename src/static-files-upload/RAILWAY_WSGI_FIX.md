# üöÄ The Wild Share - Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wsgi'** error that was preventing your application from starting on Railway.

## What Was Wrong
The `wsgi.py` file couldn't properly import the Flask app from `src.main` because the Python path wasn't set up correctly. Railway's gunicorn command was failing at startup.

## What Was Fixed
Updated `wsgi.py` to properly configure the Python path before importing the Flask application.

## üìã Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Upload the Fixed File to GitHub

You need to replace the `wsgi.py` file in your GitHub repository with the fixed version.

**Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)**

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/nmil1484/the-wild-share
2. Navigate to the `wsgi.py` file in the root directory
3. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) in the top right
4. **Delete all existing content** and replace it with the new content from `wsgi.py` (included in this package)
5. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**
6. Add commit message: "Fix wsgi.py import path for Railway deployment"
7. Click **Commit changes**

**Option B: Using Git Command Line**

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository
cd path/to/the-wild-share

# Copy the fixed wsgi.py file to your repository
# (Replace the file with the one from this package)

# Commit and push
git add wsgi.py
git commit -m "Fix wsgi.py import path for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Will Auto-Deploy

Railway is configured to automatically deploy when you push to GitHub. After you commit the fixed `wsgi.py` file:

1. Go to your Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your **The Wild Share** project
3. Click on the **web service**
4. Go to the **Deployments** tab
5. You should see a new deployment starting automatically
6. Watch the deployment logs

### Step 3: Verify Deployment Success

**Look for these SUCCESS indicators in the Railway logs:**

```
[INFO] Starting gunicorn
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:$PORT
[INFO] Booting worker with pid: XXXXX
Database tables ready!
```

**If you see these messages, your app is running! üéâ**

### Step 4: Test Your Website

Once deployment succeeds, test these URLs:

1. **Railway URL**: https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app
   - Should show The Wild Share homepage

2. **Health Check**: https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app/health
   - Should return: `{"status": "ok", "message": "The Wild Share API is running"}`

3. **Custom Domain**: http://www.thewildshare.com
   - Should redirect to your Railway app
   - Note: DNS can take up to 30 minutes to fully propagate

## üîç What Changed in wsgi.py

### Before (Broken):
```python
from src.main import app
```
‚ùå This failed because Python couldn't find the `src` module

### After (Fixed):
```python
import os
import sys

# Add the current directory to Python path
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
sys.path.insert(0, current_dir)

# Now import the app
from src.main import app
```
‚úÖ This works because we set up the path first

## üìÅ Files in This Package

- **wsgi.py** - The fixed WSGI entry point (upload this to GitHub)
- **RAILWAY_WSGI_FIX.md** - This instruction file

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click on the latest deployment
   - Look for error messages in the logs

2. **Verify the file was updated**
   - Go to https://github.com/nmil1484/the-wild-share/blob/main/wsgi.py
   - Make sure it contains the new code with `sys.path.insert(0, current_dir)`

3. **Check Railway Configuration**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí Variables
   - Make sure these environment variables are set:
     - `DATABASE_URL` (should be automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)
     - `SECRET_KEY` (optional, has default)
     - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (optional, has default)
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (for payments)
     - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (for payments)

4. **Manual Redeploy**
   - If auto-deploy doesn't trigger, go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your service ‚Üí Deployments
   - Click the **‚ãÆ** menu on the latest deployment
   - Select **Redeploy**

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

After following these steps:

1. ‚úÖ Railway deployment succeeds without errors
2. ‚úÖ Application starts and listens on the assigned port
3. ‚úÖ Database tables are created successfully
4. ‚úÖ Website loads at https://web-production-cb94.up.railway.app
5. ‚úÖ Custom domain www.thewildshare.com works (after DNS propagation)
6. ‚úÖ All API endpoints are accessible
7. ‚úÖ Frontend React app loads properly

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

Once your site is live:

1. **Test Core Features**
   - User registration and login
   - Equipment listing creation
   - Search and filtering
   - Booking system
   - Messaging between users

2. **Set Up Stripe for Production**
   - Currently using test mode
   - Switch to live Stripe keys when ready for real payments
   - Update environment variables in Railway

3. **Add Sample Equipment**
   - Create some test listings to showcase the platform
   - Add high-quality images
   - Set realistic pricing

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check Railway metrics for resource usage
   - Monitor database size
   - Review application logs regularly

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check the Railway deployment logs first
- Verify all files were uploaded correctly to GitHub
- Ensure environment variables are set in Railway
- Test the health endpoint to confirm the API is running
