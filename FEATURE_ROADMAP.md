## üöß High Priority Features to Implement

### 1. Digital Rental Contracts & E-Signatures

**Purpose:** Protect both owners and renters with legally binding agreements

**Implementation Plan:**

#### A. Contract Templates
Create standardized rental agreement templates including:
- **Equipment description and condition**
- **Rental period and pricing**
- **Liability waiver** (renter assumes responsibility for damage/loss)
- **Insurance requirements**
- **Return conditions**
- **Dispute resolution process**
- **Platform terms of service**

#### B. E-Signature Integration
**Recommended Service:** DocuSign API or HelloSign (Dropbox Sign)

**Workflow:**
1. When booking is created, generate contract PDF with booking details
2. Send to both renter and owner for e-signature
3. Store signed contract in database
4. Require signed contract before payment processing
5. Email copies to both parties

**Database Changes Needed:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE rental_contracts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookings(id),
    contract_template_id INTEGER,
    contract_pdf_url TEXT,
    renter_signed_at TIMESTAMP,
    owner_signed_at TIMESTAMP,
    docusign_envelope_id TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50), -- 'pending', 'partially_signed', 'fully_signed'
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE contract_templates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    version VARCHAR(50),
    content TEXT, -- HTML template with variables
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**API Endpoints Needed:**
- `POST /api/contracts/generate` - Generate contract for booking
- `GET /api/contracts/:id` - View contract
- `POST /api/contracts/:id/sign` - Initiate signing process
- `GET /api/contracts/:id/status` - Check signing status

**Frontend Changes:**
- Add contract review step before payment
- Show contract status in booking details
- Add "View Contract" button for completed bookings

---

### 2. Identity Verification System

**Purpose:** Verify user identities to prevent fraud and build trust

**Implementation Options:**

#### Option A: Stripe Identity (Recommended)
- **Pros:** Already using Stripe, seamless integration, compliant
- **Cons:** Costs $1.50 per verification
- **Features:** 
  - Government ID verification
  - Selfie verification
  - Liveness detection
  - Instant results

#### Option B: Persona (persona.com)
- **Pros:** More customizable, good for complex workflows
- **Cons:** More expensive, additional vendor
- **Features:**
  - ID + selfie verification
  - Database checks
  - Watchlist screening

#### Recommended Approach: Stripe Identity

**Implementation:**

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN identity_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN identity_verification_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN identity_verified_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN verification_status VARCHAR(50); -- 'unverified', 'pending', 'verified', 'failed'
```

**Workflow:**
1. Add "Verify Identity" button in user profile
2. Redirect to Stripe Identity verification flow
3. User uploads government ID (driver's license, passport)
4. User takes selfie for liveness check
5. Stripe verifies and returns result via webhook
6. Update user verification status
7. Show verification badge on profile

**Requirements:**
- Require verification for:
  - Equipment owners before listing
  - Renters before booking high-value items (>$500)
- Optional for low-value rentals to reduce friction

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/users/verify/start` - Initiate verification
- `POST /api/users/verify/webhook` - Handle Stripe webhook
- `GET /api/users/:id/verification-status` - Check status

**Frontend:**
- Verification badge on profiles
- "Verified" indicator on equipment listings
- Prompt unverified users to verify

---

### 3. In-App Messaging System

**Purpose:** Allow renters and owners to communicate securely without sharing personal contact info until after booking

**Implementation:**

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookings(id),
    renter_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_message_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    conversation_id INTEGER REFERENCES conversations(id),
    sender_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    message_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation ON messages(conversation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_unread ON messages(is_read) WHERE is_read = false;
```

**Features:**
- Real-time messaging using WebSockets (Socket.io)
- Unread message notifications
- Message history for each booking
- Automatic conversation creation when booking is made
- Option to share phone number after booking confirmed

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/conversations` - List user's conversations
- `GET /api/conversations/:id/messages` - Get messages
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages` - Send message
- `PUT /api/messages/:id/read` - Mark as read
- `WS /api/socket` - WebSocket connection for real-time

**Frontend:**
- Messages icon in navigation with unread count badge
- Conversation list page
- Message thread view
- Real-time message updates
- Push notifications for new messages

### 4. Enhanced Liability Protection

**Contract Clauses to Include:**

#### A. Liability Waiver
```

3. **Consult lawyer** for contract templates
4. **Set up Stripe Identity** in test mode
5. **Begin Phase 1 implementation**

Would you like me to start implementing any of these features now?
