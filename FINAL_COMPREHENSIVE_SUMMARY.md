## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. Stripe Boost Purchase (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** Backend complete ‚úÖ | Frontend not connected ‚ùå

**Problem:**
- Boost buttons just redirect to equipment page
- No API call to `/api/boost/purchase`
- Alert says "Stripe integration coming soon"

**Solution:**
- Complete implementation guide created: `STRIPE_BOOST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Backend API fully functional and ready to use
- Estimated implementation time: 1 hour
- Step-by-step instructions provided

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Backend `/api/boost/purchase` endpoint
- ‚úÖ Stripe checkout session creation
- ‚úÖ Payment processing
- ‚úÖ Boost activation on equipment
- ‚úÖ Webhook handling

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå Frontend boost selection modal
- ‚ùå API integration in PricingPage component
- ‚ùå Success callback handler
- ‚ùå Stripe redirect

### 2. Admin Dashboard (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status:** Not implemented

**Problem:**
- "Admin" button goes to profile settings instead of admin panel
- No way to manage all equipment/bookings/users
- No admin-specific features visible

**Recommended Solution:**
- Create dedicated admin panel with:
  - All equipment listings (with edit/delete)
  - All bookings (with status management)
  - All users (with role management)
  - Platform analytics/metrics
  - Boost management

### 3. Contract Access (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status:** Contracts generated but not accessible

**Problem:**

- Email contracts to both parties

### 4. Messaging Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status:** Messaging exists but not integrated into browsing

**Problem:**
- Users can't message equipment owners before booking

- Messaging only accessible from top nav

**Recommended Solution:**
- Add "Message Owner" button to equipment cards
- Pre-populate message with equipment context
